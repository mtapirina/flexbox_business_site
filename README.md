Challenge Project: Company Home Page with Flexbox
(https://www.codecademy.com)

Project Goals
In this project, you’ll be using flexbox to design and build the layout for a company’s homepage. You can choose to build a new homepage for an existing company or imagine your own dream company!​

You’re going to build a company homepage for a real or imagined company. You’ll get to decide exactly what content to include for this company, but you should at least include:

A title and logo or splash image.
A mission statement or brief description of the company.
A list or set of images and titles representing the product or products of the company.
A section describing some of the company’s employees or teammates.

Your project should use flexbox styling for layout. Aim to use flexbox’s advantages, such as easy horizontal and vertical positioning, flexible element flows as the page size changes, and great styling for repeated elements.

In our example project, we used flexbox to:

Create a centered navbar at the top of the page.
Create a flexible display of company products that changes from a more grid-like list to a column list as the page shrinks.
Create a flexible display of company employees.

Your page should also use custom styles for other properties, such as colors, fonts, and other layout properties such as borders and padding.
